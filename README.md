## â„¹ Overview

Memdeck card magic is technique whereby the memorization of a specific deck order can enable the magician to pull off seemingly impossible effects.

Many of these tricks require both random and sequential access into the memorized order. Practicing these tricks with a physical deck requires a lot of resetting and takes away time from developing this memory, so I've made a digital tool to speed up this process!

Currently this only supports Tamariz' Mnemonica order.

### Bonus word memorization tools

The skills and techniques required to memorize the order of a deck of cards can be applied in general to learning and memorization. This additional tool generates a pseudo-random list of words to further train the art of committing new orders to memory.
